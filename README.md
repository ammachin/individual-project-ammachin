# University Individual Project / Dissertation 

GitHub repository for the supporting code for my university dissertation. This project achieved a first class grade.

Below is a summary of the project:

A system has been designed and implemented to fly a small drone towards a smartphone. This can be broken down into three parts: a mobile phone application to estimate the phone's location, a PC application to manage the autonomous flight of the drone, and the various components that connect the two together. This was tested with a CrazyFlie drone within a netted area over a variety of test cases. The phone location estimation algorithm was found to be accurate to 2 metres in the worst case scenario, and the drone flight was accurate to 1 metre in the worst case scenario.
